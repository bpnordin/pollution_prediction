# pollution_prediction
Use weather data and pollution data to predict pollution levels in a very specific region

## scope
- I will use data for the pollutant PM2.5
- The location will be the Wasatch front in Utah here ![here](https://github.com/bpnordin/pollution_prediction/blob/main/area_map.png)
- I need to determine exactly what my goal of prediction is
    - Can I just use current weather to predict pollution levels in the future?
    - or do I need to input weather predictions for x days to get pollution level predictions
        - i can get historical data, but can i get historical model predictions?
        


## small steps
- [x] collect the pollution data for 2022
- [ ] collect the weather data
- [x] determine the location (GPS) of the data sample
- [x] make a bounding box in GPS coords of the area I am interested in
- [ ] clean the data
